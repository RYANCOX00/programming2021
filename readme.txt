JustForFun directory is my own work which is being pushed for practice



I have saved the labs in the folders numbered weekly.  

Week01 - is a HelloWorld file with a basic print function. 

Week02 - has 3 files.  
	1. Hello.py has a basic output of greeting a particular person. It also has a multiplication whereby I printed and saved the answer as a variable within the same line of code. 
	2. Hello2.py reads in the users name and returns to them with a greeting.  The second greeting goes onto a new line within the output by using \n.   The third greetings output is identical to the second greeting however the viarbales are coded using .format
	3. NameAndAge.py reads in the users name and age and returns to them with a greeting.  Name and age are saved as viarbales and are added in the response to the user using .format.   Also included in this program is two basic arithetic functions.
